# Bayesian Linear Regression Simulation & Analysis
  *Supervised by Professor Alex Franks*  
  *PSTAT 115 - Honors Contract*
  [Estimated complettion: December 6, 2025)

* Research question: With Bayesian estimation, how uncertain are we about the relationship between digital access, education, GDP and life expectancy?

* Goal: Apply Bayesian linear regression in R to quantify uncertainty in relationships among digital access, education, GDP, and life expectancy using informed priors, MCMC sampling, and convergence diagnostics

* Deliverable: 8-page-long research paper with:
  - Results from a simulation, demonstrating posterior estimation
  - Explaination of prior specification for model parameters
  - Discussions of posterior inference with MCMC simulation

* Resource: 
  - Chapters 9-11 of [Bayes Rules]([https://www.bayesrulesbook.com/])
